This repository will be for writers to write short stories and for readers who love to read stories.

### Problem Statement
This site will allow users to write short stories and will let other people/readers to submit their comments.
There will be different categories for writers and readers. For categories, I am using this website as a reference: https://awaitingthemuse.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/on-writing-10-types-of-short-stories/
It will also contain information about the category of the story.
