                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">An anecdote is a short account of something interesting and amusing, which usually tells a story about a real person and/or incident.
                        Often, anecdotes are used to illustrate or support a point in an essay, article, or chapter. They are very short but have no specific limits.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">A drabble is an exceptionally short piece of fiction, usually of exactly 100 words in length not including the title.
                        The purpose of a drabble is extreme brevity and to test an author’s skill at expressing himself/herself meaningfully and interestingly in a very confined space.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">A fable is a succinct story featuring anthropomorphic creatures (usually animals, but also mythical creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature) to tell a story with a moral.  Often the moral is explicitly told at the end.
                        A fable is similar to a parable, but differs most in the fact that fables use animals to tell a story but parables do not.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">A feghoot is an interesting short story type also known as a story pun or a poetic story joke. It is a humorous piece ending in an atrocious pun.
                        It can be very short, only long enough to sufficiently illustrate the context of the piece enough to lead up to the pun.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">A sketch story is a shorter than average piece containing little or no plot. It can be merely a description of a character or a location.
